				<strong>Exclusive: Jermain Defoe on his Rangers dream, West Ham exit and leaving Spurs twice</strong>
				<br>
				Very few players split opinion between Tottenham and West Ham fans like Jermain Defoe does.
				For the former, he is a goalscoring hero having scored almost 150 goals across two very successful spells in North London. For the latter, he’s a player who is perceived to have betrayed his roots by trying to leave at a time when the Hammers needed him most. But regardless of all that, the striker has enjoyed a hugely successful career, in which he has scored for every club he’s played for and is currently on a mission to help Rangers win their first SPL title since 2011. For young football fans, he’s a role model both on and off the pitch. If his goalscoring exploits for both club and country weren’t inspirational enough, his charitable work away from the pitch certainly is.
